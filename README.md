# WC3V

 **W**ar**c**raft **3**â„¢ Replay **V**iewer.

 Goal is to simulate enough of wc3 to get a 'birds eye view'
 of the match from a given replay.

 Examples:

 ![Happy vs Grubby showmatch on Concealed Hill](/wc3v-demo.gif)

# Usage

## Running the reference `wc3v` client viewer

(NOTE: in order to show WC3 icons, you must follow the instructions on war3observer
 and put the resulting icons in the `client/assets/wc3icons` folder).

navigate to the `client` directory

run `npm install -g http-server` to install `http-server`

run `http-server` and follow the printed directions to see the locally hosted site


Also see the [client README.md](client/README.md) for more information

## Running the `wc3v` map parser

```
note: currently built as a node project for ease of development, will eventually
be ported to web.
```

run `node wc3v.js --replay=[REPLAY NAME]`

where `REPLAY NAME` is the replay file path in the `replays` folder without any extension

**example:**

`node wc3v.js --replay=happy-vs-grubby`

### Testing mode

to run wc3v in testing mode against a set of known test maps, run:

`node wc3v.js --test`

Latest test output:

```
$ node wc3v.js --test

# Example output

see the [happy-vs-grubby.w3g.wc3v](docs/happy-vs-grubby.w3g.wc3v) file for a pretty-printed JSON dump
of the current output for a Happy vs Grubby show match.

# How It Works

See the [DESIGN.md](/docs/DESIGN.md) file

## Implemented
	
* unit selection / deselection
* unit spawning
* skill training, levels
* skill usage - point, object target, summon
* Right Click path tracking
* Hotkey Groups
* Items (partially - registrtion of shop items / giving or dropping)
* Shop tracking
* Game Time simulation
  * unit movement is simulated (turn rates and basic pathing around known buildings and terrian WIP)
  * building construction and upgrading is simulated
* Rendering 'birds eye view' of game play
* Player starting position detection
* Mirror matches

## Not implemented

* Neutral Creep tracking
* Item unit spawns
* Gold + Wood resource tracking
* Food / Upkeep tracking
